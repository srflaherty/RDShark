Welcome to RDSHark!

This software was designed to help users better upload torrents to Real-Debrid in a very automated way. The engine under the hood has features to make sure no duplicate files will be added automatically and has reasonable constant checks to ensure no uploads happen if the Real-Debrid account has hit its hard limits of active torrents downloading. There is plans for a full account management system for RD users plus options to control how the engine handles uploads. Manual features will be included and constant expansions to this project.

Let us know if you encounter any issues with this software, bug reports are welcome all the time to help this solo development improve with time. Included is a donation option if you would like to support the development, plans are to always allow this to be used fully and freely for windows users currently and expansions to other builds later will be done as well.

Enjoy!
Steven Flaherty (RDShark Developer)

NOTE: Soon as we are further in the development we will update this page with guides on how to use this software.
